## inthenews.io

The goal is to have one spot to get all the information we need to stay up to date with Python. Discover what is out there before anyone else!

#### Work in Progress

Feel free to raise issues, make pull requests(!) or leave feedback. My apologies for the lack of documentation, it will come; eventually.

#### Do It Yourself

Get up and running by cloning the project, installing the requirements and running `main.py`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kootenpv/inthenews.io.git
cd inthenews.io
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

You can now visit your local copy at <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000/</a>

#### Remote

If you want to use <a href="https://console.ng.bluemix.net/">Bluemix</a>, setup an account, login, and simply:

```bash
cf push my-inthenews
```
