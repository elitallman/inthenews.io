                        <strong>How it works</strong>
                        <hr>
                        <p> <strong>GitHub</strong> -- just posts what is trending daily. This is boring, because it's usually the same packages that are trending. I'm now preventing this, only showing new (with the occasional slip).</p>
                        <p> <strong>Reddit</strong> -- Currently I have the pathethic model that whenever something reached 30 votes, it becomes trending</p>
                        <p> <strong>Stackoverflow</strong> -- Bounty questions with the python tag are sorted on date</p>
                        <p> <strong>pypi (pip)</strong> -- Here you can simply see the packages that are most recent (so actually not trending yet, will need historic data to predict trending) </p>

                        <p> <strong>Twitter</strong> -- just the latest tweets </p>
